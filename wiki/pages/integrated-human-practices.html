            <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring">At the early stages of our project, we discussed several concepts that seemed ambitious, at least at first. After doing some research, we decided that the problem we want to address is psychiatric disorders, as we understood the impact our work would have on the people affected. At the same time, recent advances in gut microbiome research and its connection with the brain  through the gut-brain axis drew our attention. This is how we ended up combining these two ideas to design a probiotic that aims to treat depression. Our communication with experts was of utmost importance in every step of our project. Not only did they help us understand the problem- depression- better, they also offered us valuable advice on how to get started with our bibliographical research, how to set up our experiments and, lastly, how to use our results in order to propose a final product that would be highly beneficial for its end users. Moreover, through their diverse perspectives, we discovered new aspects of the project that we were able to develop.  We think it is safe to say that without the valuable feedback of all the experts listed below, our project would not be the same.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">During our discussions with these experts our project transformed from an abstract idea into an applicable plan with solid foundations. Specifically, they advised us to minimize and simplify as much as possible our experiments in order to catch up with the timeline. Besides that they gave us the criteria in order to select the best for our purpose bacterial strain and prebiotic. Lastly, they helped us in the experimental design (e.g what combination of SCFAs should we use in our cell lines, info about the LGG and more).</p>
                    <h5 class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring igemthrace-light-font">Implementation</h5>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">We carried out a screening test among several Lactobacillus strains in order to select the one that produces the SCFAs we wanted in the preferable concentrations. So we end up selecting LGG as our probiotic and as our prebiotic. Besides that we ended with several controls of our bacterial cultures in order to test the growth rate of the strain and the concentration of SCFAs produced.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">The Society of Social Psychiatry P. Sakellaropoulos, is a scientific, non-profit association, since 1986 and is an official provider of mental health services under the National Plan for Mental Health "Psychargos" of the Ministry of Health. The main purpose of the services is to inform, raise awareness and promote Mental Health through networking and cooperation with agencies and society.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">The experienced psychologists and social workers of the association provide prevention, support and treatment services, special home care, psychosocial rehabilitation and community education in cities and hard-to-reach areas.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Our team consulted psychologists and social workers who highlighted that neglecting proper nutrition is a symptom of depression. They appreciated the application's feature of providing nutritional advice, recognizing the significance of holistic approaches in treating mental illnesses, incorporating both diet and exercise.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">The experts emphasized that the app would resonate well with younger individuals experiencing depression, given their familiarity with technology. They also noted its relevance for people with anxiety disorders, who frequently seek health information online. However, they expressed their concern that, as with most applications, apps that are easy to download are equally easy to uninstall.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">They recommended incorporating a feature in the app that displays nearby mental health specialists. This would serve as an encouragement and simplify the process for users seeking professional help.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Furthermore, the expert group reviewed the questionnaire designed for the general public. They proposed modifications to the phrasing of questions and answer options to ensure accuracy. Additionally, they recommended including questions about gender, marital status, education level, and type of residential area at the beginning of the anonymous questionnaire. This addition aims to facilitate a more precise analysis of the collected data.</p>
                    <h5 class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring igemthrace-light-font" style="width:fit-content">Implementation</h5>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Our discussion with this group proved to be highly valuable and influential in shaping various aspects of the project. Following our meeting, we made adjustments to the questionnaire based on their suggestions. We were now prepared to distribute it to both our contacts and individuals we engaged with during the activities we organized and the events we attended (you can find the questionnaire form and results below). Additionally, we implemented the feature in the app that shows nearby mental health specialists, enhancing the app's comprehensiveness and efficiency. </p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">After a very interesting conversation with Mr. Kolovos, he suggested that the modification of the genome of Lactobacillus would not be preferable due to the technical and biological difficulties that would come up if we wanted to introduce our whole new gene cassette permanently in the genome. Also, he made a point about the change of a cis-component (e.g. a promoter) that we could change it in a way that it would be stronger and thus lead to higher production of protein.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Since modifying an organism and making the changes directly in its genetic makeup poses technical difficulties and threatens the overall quality of expression of our gene cassette, we decided that we would not include any experimental step that performs genetic modification of the genome makeup. So our selection marker for the food-grade plasmid should be dominant and not complementary (like any lac gene). Moreover, we decided to include not only a constitutive promoter but a strong-regulated one as well.</p>

In the beginning, when we still weren’t sure that there is enough bibliography to base our project on, his research encouraged us a lot. He also helped us a lot with some initial technical details. We talked about the cell line we are going to use in our experiments, its advantages and disadvantages and how we could possibly model the gut-brain axis in vitro. Finally, as he is himself working in a  pharmaceutical corporation, we discussed the future directions our project could take and how it could, as a last step, be implemented in the every-day life of patients.</p>

He advised us to not follow this approach because it makes many assumptions and might produce significant errors. He proposed different methods to study the complexity of microbiome metabolites which was our eventual approach.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">We wanted to manually find and download the metagenomes that concerned us but he suggested using the NCBI database package and the API from GTDB database, thus we won valuable time. We wanted to acquire a specific strain for each bacterial species, so he directed us to use representative genomes from the GTDB database. Suggestions for genome annotation software like “Prokka”, “Prodigal” and ”Bakta” were really helpful as we had no previous background experience in genomics analysis.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Mr. Sandaltzopoulos provided us with some highly important information regarding our project. Firstly, we evaluated our project and our aims. We examined the metabolic pathway that we wanted to introduce into our host strain. He advised us to ensure that the chemical reaction of each biochemical pathway should be ideally one-directional and be more favored from other biochemical pathways for our final product, butyrate, to be produced.</p>
                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">Subsequently, he proposed that the genes and the sequences overall should be codon-optimized for the hosts that we would use, to have a proper expression. Next, we discussed more in-depth the expression and cis components that we should include on the cassette. He suggested that before every gene we should include a ribosome binding site, after the final gene we should include a terminator compatible with Lactobacillus as well as a promoter in the start that is constitutive and compatible with our genus. Moreover, he was very concerned about the implementation of our project in the real world. He proposed a more compatible by the food regulations way for designing our plasmid. More specifically, he advised us to design a food-grade plasmid, which is different and safer for the human organism, because it is composed of DNA of Generally Recognised as Safe organism (for example L.lactis) and includes a safe marker such as nisin and does not have an antibiotic resistance marker (for no antibiotic resistance gene to crossover another organism in human and end up in antibiotic resistance).</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">We redesigned the part that we would like to improve for the gold criteria, including the aforementioned cis-regulatory components. Also, we changed our minds from ordering a typical plasmid for Lactobacillus to designing one that is food-grade, suitable for Lactobacillus, and compatible with any legislation for genetically modified organisms in foods. We also checked the chemical reactions and interactions that would take place, based on previous similar experiments and bibliography, to form a complete and comprehensive troubleshooting at the end of our experiments.</p>

                    <p class="igemthrace-white-text-coloring">After our project presentation, Mrs. Antoniadou and Mrs. Kalozoumi talked to us about the process of marketing nutritional supplements. However, according to legislation in Greece, it is not allowed to make health claims about probiotics. In other words, a nutritional supplement package containing probiotics cannot attribute specific actions to the probiotic, even if it is the main active component. In addition, they talked to us about the advantages of encapsulating the probiotic. They explained that inside a capsule, it is easy to maintain an adequate amount of probiotic, and if the capsule is enteric soluble, the risk of destroying a portion of the probiotic due to the acidic environment of the stomach is reduced.</p>

        <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">In collaboration with the Group of Psychologists and Social Workers of the Society of Social Psychiatry P. Sakellaropoulos, we created a questionnaire addressed to the general public.To obtain diverse opinions and feedback, we distributed this questionnaire to both our friends and families, as well as during conferences and outreach events that we organized. This approach ensured that we received feedback from individuals of various ages and academic backgrounds, each with different experiences and perspectives. You can find more information about these initiatives in the <a style="text-decoration-line: underline;" href="https://2023.igem.wiki/thrace/education-public-engagement">Education and Public Engagement Page</a>. 
 Through this questionnaire, we were able to evolve and add additional features to make the application more user-friendly. This process also ensured that the user is using a trusted and secure environment:</p>

          <img style="width:100%;" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4989/wiki/wiki/questionnaire.png">
        </div>
        <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">After analyzing feedback from the graph above, it became clear that a significant number of participants are hesitant to seek help from a mental health expert. In response to this, we have decided to introduce an additional feature in our application that encourages users to consider consulting a mental health professional. This new feature allows users to share their chatbot conversations with experts.</p>
        <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Also,one of the survey questions asked participants what they expect from our application, and many expressed concerns about the accuracy of our machine learning model. To address this concern, we have significantly improved our model's training by utilizing a large dataset sourced from various scientific references, encompassing both depressive and non-depressive texts.</p>
        <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Moreover, addressing worries about personal data security, we have taken measures to safeguard user data. Instead of storing their responses in a cloud-based system, we have developed a local database for secure data storage. Additionally, to ensure the utmost data privacy, we have chosen to deploy our neural network locally, avoiding the use of any cloud platforms and thus making any potential data leaks impossible.</p>

Our Human Practices efforts influenced the project's purpose, design, and execution, with a focus on responsible and reflective implementation. We integrated personal reflections, extensive research, and stakeholder feedback into our decision-making, aligning our project with the needs of the community.
