          <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Our team embarked on an exciting journey to engage with young minds at a local secondary school. Our goal was to not only introduce students to the fascinating world of synthetic biology but also to inspire and nurture their curiosity about science and the possibilities it holds.</p>
          <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">We had the privilege of interacting with four enthusiastic classes during our visit to the secondary school. We introduced students to synthetic biology through real-world examples. From bioengineered medicines to sustainable bioplastics, we showcased how synthetic biology is shaping the future. To give students a glimpse into the microscopic world, we provided hands-on experience with microscopes. Students observed cellular structures such as chloroplasts after first seeing what they looked like and being able to identify them on their own. They also saw the result of the strawberry DNA extraction experiment we had prepared before our arrival, because the duration of a class wouldn’t allow us to make the experiment from the beginning.</p>
          <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">One of the most rewarding aspects of our visit was the engaging Q&A session. Students were curious about various aspects of synthetic biology, and we eagerly answered their questions. We discussed topics ranging from the life of a molecular biology and genetics student, sparking their interest in potential career paths within the field.</p>
          <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Our visit to the secondary school was a fulfilling experience for both our team and the students we interacted with. We hope that our presentations, experiments, and discussions have inspired these young minds to explore the wonders of science further.</p>

            </div> 
            <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">On the 28th of April our team organized a live hands-on workshop on the 1st Panhellenic Conference of Students Bioscientists. The context of the workshop was real-time mathematical modeling of genetic circuits using tools and bioinformatics software that can quantify a system’s behavior.</p>
            <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">The workshop started with an introduction on both mathematical and biological concepts, such as central dogma of molecular biology, gene regulation, computational logic gates and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Hands-On part included design of hypothetical gene circuits, with description of their expected behavior using ODE’s. Google Colab and scientific computational libraries like python’s numpy and scipy, helped the students observe the change in the system’s expression, when changing transcription and translation constants. After students were familiarized with the mathematical background, we moved on to the program “<a href="http://www.tinkercell.com/">tinkercell</a>”. This software is developed with a GUI, to help design easily, more complex biological systems. Students simulated the behavior of complex gene regulation cases, such as  double-positive regulation, plasmid-protein expression and oscillators. At the end, some examples of stochastic simulations were also delivered.</p>

            </div> 
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Wanting to highlight the beneficial effect of physical exercise on mental health and well-being, by actively participating in the actions of our region, we participated in the Thrace night race held for the third consecutive year on the beach road of Alexandroupoli. It consisted of 2 running races of 5km and 10km in which runners of various ages took part.</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">One of the most rewarding aspects of the Night Run was the opportunity to engage in meaningful conversations with runners and citizens of all ages. We discussed the physical and mental benefits of exercise, shared insights from our iGEM project, and learned about personal experiences with mental health challenges. These interactions fostered a sense of camaraderie and highlighted the importance of open dialogue surrounding mental well-being.</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Our discussion with the audience was rounded off by the brochures we created specifically for the race, which showcased these benefits to both mental and physical health. In addition, it listed the recommended time for physical activity according to the World Health.</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Organization and there was a diary, in which one could note the days one has exercised. In other words, whoever used it could track the days they exercised until the end of the year, thus setting their goals. Our goal was to create a simple and easy-to-read brochure, which would also have a practical use and could be used by people of all ages.</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">Finally, we had the pleasure of volunteering to help run the race by handing out water and bananas after the races ended but also by creating a 'human chain' to kickstart the races.</p>

            </div> 
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">As a team dedicated to community participation and well-being, we participated in a blood drive, which takes place every Sunday. Recognizing the significant problem of blood shortage in Greece, we took action to raise awareness among the younger population and invite them to donate blood through social media posts and posters</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">We met with blood donors and the doctors there, discussing with them the importance of blood donation and the critical need for blood in Greece. In our interactions, we introduced the concept of the gut-brain axis and explained its importance in mental health. We shared information about our project, explaining how our genetically modified probiotic works and our application and their potential impact on mental health. To express our gratitude to the blood donors, we offered them sweets and handmade items created by our team members.</p>
              <p class="igemthrace-blue-text-coloring m-3">We believe that by combining efforts to address blood deficiency and promote mental health, we can create a healthier and more informed community.</p>
